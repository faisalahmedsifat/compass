# 🧭 Compass

**A lightweight CLI tool that sees your complete workspace - every window, every app, every context.**

Compass is a simple command-line application that runs quietly in your terminal, tracking your entire digital workspace - all 15 windows across VS Code, Chrome with 47 tabs, that Terminal running in the background, Spotify playing your focus playlist, and yes, that Discord you forgot was open. View your stats through a clean local web dashboard.

## 🚀 Current Status: MVP Ready

- [ ] Lightweight CLI tool (single binary)
- [ ] Complete window tracking (active + all background)
- [ ] Local web dashboard (http://localhost:8080)
- [ ] Application state monitoring
- [ ] Screenshot capture with privacy controls
- [ ] Smart categorization (no AI needed)
- [ ] Browser tab tracking (Week 2)
- [ ] Optional AI summaries (Week 3)

## 🎯 The Problem

Current time trackers are blind. They see:
```
Active Window: VS Code (3 hours)
```

But miss the complete picture:
```
Active: VS Code (dashboard.tsx)
Background Windows:
├── Chrome (47 tabs)
│   ├── localhost:3000 (testing)
│   ├── React Documentation (reference)
│   └── Stack Overflow (debugging)
├── Terminal (npm run dev)
├── Another VS Code window (backend/api.go)
├── Postman (API testing)
├── Slack (2 unread messages)
└── Spotify (Focus Playlist)

Context: Full-stack development with active debugging
```

## 🎨 What Makes Compass Different

### Complete Workspace Intelligence
Compass captures **EVERYTHING** running on your computer:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  "workspace": {
    "active_window": {
      "app": "Visual Studio Code",
      "title": "dashboard.tsx — compass-frontend",
      "pid": 1234,
      "focus_time": "12m 34s"
    },
    "all_windows": [
      {
        "app": "Visual Studio Code",
        "title": "dashboard.tsx — compass-frontend",
        "status": "ACTIVE",
        "pid": 1234

  }
}
```

### Smart Categorization (No AI Required)

Compass understands what you're doing by analyzing your window combinations:

| Active Window | Background Windows | = Activity |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| VS Code | Chrome (localhost) + Terminal | = **Development & Testing** |
| Chrome (docs) | VS Code + Terminal | = **Learning & Implementing** |
| Slack | VS Code (with git diff) | = **Code Review Discussion** |
| Terminal (git) | VS Code + Chrome (GitHub) | = **Version Control** |
| Chrome (YouTube) | VS Code paused | = **Tutorial/Learning** |

## 📸 MVP Features (Available Day 1)

### 1. Complete Window Tracking
- **Active Window**: What has focus right now
- **All Background Windows**: Every single open window
- **Window Relationships**: Which windows work together
- **Focus Duration**: How long each window was active
- **Switch Patterns**: How you move between windows

### 2. Application Intelligence
```go
type WindowInfo struct {
    AppName       string    // "Visual Studio Code"
    WindowTitle   string    // "server.go — my-project"
    ProcessID     int       // 1234
    Status        string    // "ACTIVE" | "BACKGROUND" | "MINIMIZED"
    FocusTime     Duration  // How long it's been active
    LastActive    Time      // When it was last in focus
    Position      Rectangle // Where on screen
    Monitor       int       // Which monitor (multi-monitor support)
}
```

### 3. Smart Context Detection
Without any AI, Compass identifies:
- **Development Sessions**: IDE + localhost + terminal
- **Debugging**: Error in terminal + Stack Overflow + IDE
- **Learning**: Documentation/Tutorial + IDE + note-taking app
- **Communication**: Slack/Discord + code snippets visible
- **Deep Work**: Single app focus for >25 minutes
- **Context Switching**: Rapid window changes

### 4. Local Web Dashboard

Access your stats at `http://localhost:8080` while Compass runs in your terminal:

## 💻 Technical Architecture

### Simple CLI Design
```
compass (CLI binary)
├── Runs in terminal or background
├── Captures workspace every 10 seconds
├── Stores data in local SQLite
└── Serves dashboard on :8080

No desktop app, no system tray, no complex UI
Just a CLI tool + web dashboard
```

### Window Tracking Method
```go
// Every 10 seconds
snapshot := CaptureWorkspace()

// Returns
type Workspace struct {
    Active      WindowInfo
    Windows     []WindowInfo  // ALL windows
    Timestamp   time.Time
    Screenshot  []byte        // Optional
}
```

### Categorization Engine (No AI)
```go
func CategorizeActivity(windows []WindowInfo) string {
    active := windows[0]
    background := windows[1:]
    
    // Smart rule matching
    if hasIDE(active) && hasLocalhost(background) {
        return "Development"
    }
    if hasTerminalError(background) && hasBrowser(active) {
        return "Debugging"  
    }
    // ... more rules
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. **Build the CLI** (30 seconds)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/faisalahmedsifat/compass.git
   cd compass && go build -o compass
   ```

2. **Start tracking** (in terminal)
   ```bash
   ./compass start
   # Or run in background: ./compass start --daemon
   ```

3. **Open Dashboard** (in browser)
   - Visit http://localhost:8080
   - See your complete workspace
   - Watch patterns emerge

4. **Stop tracking**
   ```bash
   # If running in foreground: Ctrl+C
   # If running as daemon: ./compass stop
   ```

5. **Check your stats**
   ```bash
   ./compass stats  # Quick terminal summary
   ./compass export  # Export your data
   ```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this a desktop app?**  
A: No! Compass is a simple CLI tool that runs in your terminal. View your stats through the local web dashboard at localhost:8080.

**Q: Does it need to run in the foreground?**  
A: Your choice! Run with `compass start` (foreground) or `compass start --daemon` (background).

**Q: How do I view my data?**  
A: Two ways: Open http://localhost:8080 for the full dashboard, or use `compass stats` for a quick terminal summary.

**Q: Does this work without AI?**  
A: Yes! The MVP uses smart pattern matching to understand your workspace. AI is completely optional for Week 3+.

**Q: What about performance?**  
A: Minimal impact. ~30MB RAM, <1% CPU. It's just a CLI tool with a lightweight web server.

**Q: Can I exclude private windows?**  
A: Yes! Configure exclusions in config.yaml. Sensitive apps are never tracked.

**Q: How is this different from RescueTime/Toggl?**  
A: We track ALL windows and their relationships, not just the active one. Plus, it's a simple CLI tool, not a heavy desktop app.

**Q: Is my data safe?**  
A: 100% local. No servers, no accounts, no uploads. Your data never leaves your machine.
