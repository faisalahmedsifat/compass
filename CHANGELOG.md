## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Configurable screenshot intervals** - Screenshots can now be captured at different intervals than workspace capture
- **Enhanced configuration documentation** - Added comprehensive CONFIG.md and improved README configuration sections
- **Configuration development guidelines** - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with configuration management best practices
- **Cursor AI rules** - Added .cursorrules file to ensure documentation consistency

### Changed

- **Screenshot capture logic** - Screenshots now use independent timing from workspace capture
- **Configuration structure** - Added `screenshot_interval` field to tracking configuration
- **Documentation structure** - Improved configuration documentation with examples and troubleshooting

### Configuration

- **New option**: `tracking.screenshot_interval` - Controls how often screenshots are taken (default: 60s)
- **Backward compatible** - Existing configurations continue to work with sensible defaults
- **Validation added** - Screenshot interval must be at least 1 second

### Examples

```yaml
# High-frequency monitoring with reasonable screenshots
tracking:
  interval: 10s           # Workspace capture every 10 seconds
  screenshot_interval: 300s  # Screenshots every 5 minutes

# Battery-optimized configuration
tracking:
  interval: 30s           # Less frequent workspace capture
  screenshot_interval: 600s  # Screenshots every 10 minutes
```

### Planned for v0.2.0

- Linux window tracking support
- Windows window tracking support
- Browser tab extraction
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced categorization rules

### Planned for v0.3.0

- Local AI integration (Ollama)
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Productivity insights
- Team collaboration features (optional)

### Planned for v1.0.0

- IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Mobile companion app
- Advanced analytics
- Export integrations (Toggl, RescueTime)
